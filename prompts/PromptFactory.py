                                context if they are relevant. Otherwise, ignore them if they are not relevant.
                                Do not hallucinate, if the context is not relevant just say that you dont know the answer.
                                Try to generate a numbered list or bullet point list as output if you think is possible.
                                Only response if given context.

                            Only use the output of your code to answer the question. 
                            You might know the answer without running any code, but you should still run the code to get the answer.
